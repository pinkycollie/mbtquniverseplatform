# üîÆ 360 MAGICIANS

## üåê Platform Domains & Innovation Process

- **[360magicians.com](https://360magicians.com):**  
  Our main platform for Deaf professionals, employers, and partners to access all services, resources, and tools.

- **[360magicians.mbtquniverse.com](https://360magicians.mbtquniverse.com):**  
  Our innovation and governance hub, currently operating as a Web2-based community platform. Here, new ideas, features, and proposals are submitted and discussed by the community.  
  Once proposals are approved, they advance to be implemented or integrated into the main 360magicians platform.  
  **Note:** mbtquniverse is currently Web2-based, but we aim to transition to a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model in the future to further empower community-driven growth and collaboration.

*Have a great idea or want to help shape the platform? Propose it at [360magicians.mbtquniverse.com](https://360magicians.mbtquniverse.com)! Once approved, it can become part of the 360magicians ecosystem.*
